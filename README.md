# Piscine42

This was everything i managed to do for 4 weeks at 42 in Heilbronn
I managed to get to level 6. Got 3 out of 4 exams. Overall for me was easy to manage and do well in the piscine
because i had some previous experience but i learned so much as well.

If u decide that you want as well to participate in the 42 doesnt matter where just so you know you will be all alone and no one
will help you. You and the rest "pisciners" will have to find a way how to "swim" there and "survive".

In total ive spent 8 hours a day for 4 weeks straight no days off.
